## Introduction to Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** allows computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It's used in image recognition, speech processing, translation, and recommendation systems.

## Why is Machine Learning Needed?

1. **Solves Complex Problems** – Used in diagnosis, language translation, sentiment analysis.  
2. **Handles Big Data** – Analyzes large datasets for real-time predictions.  
3. **Automates Tasks** – Powers spam filters, chatbots, and document analysis.  
4. **Personalizes Experience** – Suggests content (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).  
5. **Learns Over Time** – Improves with more data (e.g., voice assistants, search).

## Why Data Matters

- Data is essential for training ML models.  
- Better data = better predictions.  
- Features help models learn.  
- Test data ensures accuracy.  
- New data helps improve performance.
