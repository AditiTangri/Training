## Types of Machine Learning

There are several primary types of Machine Learning, each suited to specific problems and data scenarios:

1. **Supervised Learning**  
2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning** *(Hybrid of supervised and unsupervised)*

---

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning uses **labeled data**, where both input and correct output are known. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs.

- **Example:** Classifying images as cats or dogs using labeled image data.

**Applications:**  
- Image and speech recognition  
- Email spam detection  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Fraud detection  

---

### 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with **unlabeled data**, identifying hidden patterns or structures without predefined categories.

- **Example:** Segmenting customers by purchasing behavior without prior labeling.

**Applications:**  
- Customer segmentation  
- Anomaly detection  
- Recommendation systems  
- Topic modeling  

---

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement learning involves an **agent** that learns through **trial and error** by interacting with an environment. It receives **rewards or penalties** based on its actions.

- **Example:** Training an AI to play chess â€” it learns strategies by being rewarded for winning moves.

**Applications:**  
- Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo)  
- Robotics and autonomous vehicles  
- Smart recommendations  
- Healthcare decision systems  

---

### 4. Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines **a small amount of labeled data** with a **large amount of unlabeled data**. It is useful when labeled data is expensive or scarce.

- **Application Example:** Classifying rare diseases with limited labeled medical records and abundant unlabeled records.
