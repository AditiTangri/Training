## What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. The term "Linux" often refers to GNU + Linux, combining the Linux kernel (developed by Linus Torvalds) with GNU tools.

Originally inspired by Unix, Linux has grown into a powerful OS used in servers, desktops, mobile devices, embedded systems, and more. Its flexibility, security, and open-source nature make it popular across various applications.

### Use of Linux Commands

Linux commands are basic tools used to interact with the Linux operating system through the command line. They help users perform various tasks, such as viewing, creating, and managing files and directories.

Linux is widely used on servers, desktops, and even smartphones. It offers many command-line tools that can handle almost any task on the system.

## Essential Linux Commands

### `pwd` command in Linux

The `pwd` command is mostly used to print the current working directory on your terminal. It is also one of the most commonly used commands.

```bash
pwd
```
### `mkdir` command in Linux
This `mkdir` command allows you to create fresh directories in the terminal itself. The default syntax is mkdir <directory name> and the new directory will be created.

```bash
mkdir <directory_name>
```
### `cd` command in Linux
The `cd` command is used to navigate between directories. It requires either the full path or the directory name, depending on your current working directory. 

```bash
cd /home/user/documents
cd .. # Go up one directory
cd my_new_directory # Go into a directory within the current path
```
### `rmdir` command in Linux
The `rmdir` command is used to delete permanently an empty directory. To perform this command the user running this command must be having sudo privileges in the parent directory. 

```bash
rmdir empty_directory_name
```

### `cp` command in Linux
The `cp` command of Linux is equivalent to copy-paste and cut-paste in Windows. 

```bash
cp source_file.txt destination_directory/
cp file_to_copy.txt new_name_for_copy.txt
```

### `mv` command in Linux
The `mv` command is generally used for renaming the files in Linux.

```bash
mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt
mv file_to_move.txt destination_directory/
```

### `clear` command in Linux
The `clear` command is a standard command to clear the terminal screen.

```bash
clear
```
